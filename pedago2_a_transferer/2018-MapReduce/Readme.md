# MapReduce activity

This activity is based on an original idea of Florestan De Moor.

## Goals

This activity aims at giving a brief introduction to the MapReduce paradigm to perform parallel computations on large chunks of data.

## Required material

* Cards to print and cut

## Target audience

This activity requires the knowledge of simple additions, and can generally be exercised from 8 years old.

## Generate the cards

Pre-generated examples are available in the repository.
It is however possible to generate new cards by running a Python script as follows:
```./booklet.sh```
The script uses several pictures from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) licensed under CC-BY 4.0.

## Workflow

The goal is to find the answer to each question, under different scenarios.
During the first step, a single individual is involved while they can require help from others during the second step.
A timer can be used as an incentive for the participants to act more efficiently, especially during the second step.
The participants can be asked to describe precisely the strategy they chose to solve the problem, and to discuss its strengths and limitations.

1. How many rockets are there in the whole set of cards?
2. Are there more men or more stars?
