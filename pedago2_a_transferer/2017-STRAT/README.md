# Strategic Reasoning

To the best of my knowledge, there is no activity speaking about the
topic of strategic reasoning. The intuition to give in this activity
would be to show how a computer "thinks" in a game and the how
powerful the reasoning is. We could discuss the single agent case as
well as the multi agent one and demonstrate, in a intuitive way, why
multi agent reasoning requires so much computation
(2EXPTIME-complete).

Note: "plan" and "strategy" are used through out this activity for the
same idea.

## Single Agent Activity

The critical point to address in this activity is how all planning
problems are related and that reasoning about a game and a system can,
in fact, be equivalent challenges. Using a maze game, the river
crossing game and -something else to define- to introduce the idea of
strategy in a game. Note: It could be intersting to have equivalent
strategies in each of those games to (by a simple translation or
without) demonstrate that even if the intuitive reasoning used by the
public was different, it ends up giving the same resulting plan.

Note: a tree decomposition of the game can give good intuition for the
second part.

## Multi Agent Activity

In this part, we could use multiple examples of multi-agent system as
well. For instance, tic tac toe, itinerary for cars and -something
else to define- are easy to understand and simple to solve multi-agent
systems. Note: Showing to the public that there exist a optimal
strategy to never lose playing tic tac toe could a way to get their
attention back. From this point, we can create an alternative of the
maze game previously stated and add an entity which can move walls to
explicit the addition of branching to the tree decomposition.

## Strategy Activity

From this point, we need to display the meaning of winning strategy,
the need to have a strategy which wins against all the strategies of
the opponents. In other word, we could take a strategy which wins in a
certain settings but won't "for all".

## Addition

This is a scratch of an activity, there are a lot of points to
address:
- At least two games are needed to complete.
- Equivalent instances are needed to be build.
- How to give the intuiton of the tree decomposition point.
- Give the optimal strategy in tic tac toe.
- How to define a strategy.
- Intuitive way of showing the exponential blowup of the reasoning in
  multi-agent.
